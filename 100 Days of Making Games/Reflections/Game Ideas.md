[[Vulcanists VS Neptunists Megagame]]
- A [[megagame]] about a gradual scientific revolution. Where a new understanding of the world emerges. Where the scientific method is our into practice but the outcome is not certain. 

What if there is a sacred text/rules that explains how the world works but it is inaccurate

What if there is a world to be uncovered or a truth that lies hidden and is not obvious. I guess sort of like the game in the Three Body Problem
 
# Specific Game Ideas
- A [[runic]] story based #game/ttrpg [[card-game]] #game 
- [[Astrology Game]]
- [[Idea for a Generative TTRPG]]
- [[Generation Ship Game]]



Enamored suddenly with the idea of just writing a story. Building a world. Inspired by the rich world building in Pentiment and Citizen Sleeper. It also intersects nicely with this excitement again about plain text. About mess. making a [[rpg]] [[Games]]
